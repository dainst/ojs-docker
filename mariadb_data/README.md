Put your OJS backup SQL file here. If you want to initialize an empty OJS installation, run

```bash
cp init.sql_template init.sql
```

This will initialize the MariaDB with a bare bones OJS installation that contains empty stubs for all our journals. The user is the default as defined in `.env_template`.

# ojs3-docker

## Description

This repository offers a fully dockerized version of [PKP's](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) OJS 3 in addition to a set of DAI specific plugins. The repository offers easy to use shell scripts to help with handling Docker. By default all data will be encapsuled in Docker Volumes and can therefore be used in multiple instances of the container.

**This may take a couple of minutes on first startup.**

After the first startup, any container using the prepared volumes will start within seconds.

## Versions

The image is based on the official **php:7.3-apache** image.

The stack defined in the docker-compose file also adds a database container based on the latest version of the official mariadb image.

## Configuration

Configuration files can be found in the _conf folder_.

## Usage

### Git submodules

Initialize submodules by running

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    
    
### .env file
Copy the .env-default template 

    cp .env-default .env

and customize its contents.

### OJS SQL dump

Make sure you put an OJS SQL dump into the appropriate [directory](mariadb_data) and that the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) correctly mounts that file as a volume into the MariaDB image.

### Docker

Managing the image is done by docker-compose.

Build the image with

    docker-compose build

Start the container with

    docker-compose up

Stop the container by terminating the process (ctrl+C) or using

    docker-compose stop
    
Destroy all existing containers (including all changes to mariadb) with

    docker-compose down -v
    
## XDebug

The repo is configured for using xdebug. However, one needs to make the appropriate settings inside one's own ide. Dependig on which type one is using, this differ a little. 

### VSCode

If you don't have a lunch.json
Click on Debug -> Start debugging. In the opening popup choose php as option. 
Now you have a autogenerated lunch.json, the countend should look like this.
You need to add the pathMappings, and adjust the path to your lokal folder.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for XDebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9000,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/html": "/path/to/workspace/ojs"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Launch currently open script",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
            "port": 9000
        }
    ]
}
```

Now you can start a debug session. Navigate to the debug tab on the right side of your screen and hit the small run symbol in your upper part of the righthand column.

A small overlay with a play, stop and other buttons should open.
